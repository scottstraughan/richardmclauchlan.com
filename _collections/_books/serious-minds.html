      <h1>Overview</h1>
    </header>

    <p><em>The Times</em> hailed Richard Burdon Haldane as ‘one of the most powerful … intellects’ British statesmanship
      had ever seen. His brother John, a great physiologist, invented the first gas masks used in World War One. Their
      sister Elizabeth was among the first women to become a senior public servant. Their mother Mary, friend and
      advisor to top politicians and churchmen, nurtured these exceptional minds.</p>

    <p>Mary’s grandchildren swapped her traditional roots for radical socialism, but continued the brilliant family
      legacy. Naomi Mitchison was a doyenne of Scottish literature; one Nobel prizewinner called her brother, the
      geneticist J.B.S. Haldane, ‘the cleverest man I ever knew’. Like the Darwins and Keyneses, this clan of thinkers
      lived in rapidly changing times, and helped to remake the world around them.</p>

    <p>Drawing on extensive family interviews and previously unseen private papers, <em>Serious Minds</em> details
      scandal, tragedy and achievement within a dynasty that shaped modern Britain–from the welfare state, education
      system and military, to our understanding of energy, the human body, and the origins of life itself.</p>
