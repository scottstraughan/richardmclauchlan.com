    </header>

    <p>History’s first named bagpiper is a man playing a pipe ‘with a bag tucked under his armpit’ in the first
      century CE. He was the Roman Emperor Nero. Since then, this improbable conflation of bag and sticks has become
      the world’s most beloved and contested instrument. Another piping emperor, Tsar Peter the Great, decided that
      his departed pet bear would live on—as a bagpipe.</p>

    <p>This vivid history tells the long story of an instrument boasting over 130 varieties, yet commonly associated
      with just one, from one country: Scotland’s Great Highland Bagpipe. In fact, the pipes are played across the
      globe, illuminating societies in remarkable, unexpected ways. Richard McLauchlan charts the rise of women pipers;
      investigates class, privilege and capitalism in the piping world; and explores how a ‘national instrument’ can
      shift in meaning amidst the currents of identity.</p>

    <p>The vibrancy and inventiveness of today’s pipers showcase the allure of this fabled, fascinating instrument, to
      which McLauchlan is our surefooted guide.</p>

      <li>‘With infectious enthusiasm for his subject, Richard McLauchlan traces the cultural significance of the bagpipes
        across the globe and over many centuries. His multi-storied and learned account reveals the bagpipes’ history to
        be just as intricate and variegated as the most complex <i>piobaireachd</i>/pibroch tunes showcased by its
        virtuosi practitioners.’ — Clare Jackson, author of <i>Devil-Land: England under Siege 1588-1688</i></li>
