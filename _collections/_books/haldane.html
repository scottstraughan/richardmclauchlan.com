      <h1>Overview</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Can you name the creator of the Territorial Army and the British Expeditionary Force? The man who laid the
      foundation stones of MI5, MI6, the RAF, the LSE, Imperial College, the ‘redbrick’ universities and the Medical
      Research Council?</p>

    <p>This book reveals that great figure: Richard Burdon Haldane. As a philosopher-statesman, his groundbreaking
      proposals on defence, education and government structure were astonishingly ahead of his time—the very building
      blocks of modern Britain. His networks ranged from Wilde to Einstein, Churchill to Carnegie, King to Kaiser; he
      pioneered cross-party, cross-sector cooperation. Yet in 1915 Haldane was ejected from the Liberal government,
      unjustly vilified as a German sympathiser.</p>

    <p>John Campbell charts these ups and downs, reveals Haldane’s intensely personal side through previously
      unpublished private correspondence, and shows his enormous relevance in our search for just societies today.
      Amidst political and national instability, it is time to reinstate Haldane as Britain’s outstanding example of
      true statesmanship.</p>

    <h1>Reviews</h1>

    <ol>
      <li>‘An act of homage to a man for whom [Campbell] asserts lifelong admiration … [This is an] intelligent book.’ —
        The Sunday Times</li>

      <li>‘A biography worthy of his memory.’ — The Times of Scotland</li>

      <li>‘A work of real scholarship.’ — The Telegraph</li>

      <li>‘Richly informed … [an] engaging biography.’ — Financial Times</li>

      <li>‘[Campbell] makes a persuasive case for his subject’s importance and, along the way, touches on larger questions
        of culture and governance … [With a] wealth of detail and insightful character sketches … [this is a] splendid
        portrait.’ — The Wall Street Journal</li>

      <li>‘[A] valuable book … the research has been done superlatively. … Anyone interested in political history who is
        unacquainted with Haldane will find this book illuminating and informative.’ — The Spectator</li>

      <li>‘The author must be congratulated on shaking up the creaking cradle-to-grave style of conventional political
        biography. … Campbell has succeeded in his aim of writing a biography of Haldane which might serve as a handbook
        of leadership and statesmanship in this post-Brexit age.’ — The Literary Review</li>

      <li>‘This is a delightful, rather personal and yet thorough and rigorous story of a man who for once lives up to the
        title of his biography … it is worth submersing yourself in it over a reasonably lengthy period.’ — The Round
        Table</li>

      <li>‘[An] engaging biography … Campbell makes a good case that Haldane was a key catalyst in improving the
        effectiveness of certain aspects of the British state in the years either side of the first world war.’ — Morning
        Star</li>

      <li>‘Well-researched and well-written.’ — The Critic</li>

      <li>‘A noble undertaking that does much to revive the lamentably neglected legacy of one of Britain’s finest
        statesmen.’ — The Irish Examiner</li>

      <li>‘Excellent … [Haldane] is timely, well researched and reminds us what we owe to a great statesman.’ —
        Reaction</li>

      <li>‘There is something perennially fascinating about the sensitive polymath. John Campbell has written a magisterial
        biography of such a figure—an immensely readable account of an extraordinary life. This is, quite simply, a
        triumph of the art of conveying the texture of human affairs and the events of an era. It is a major and lasting
        achievement.’ — Alexander McCall Smith</li>

      <li>‘A labour of love. Haldane is rescued from “the condescension of posterity”, his achievement in war and peace is
        finally recognised, and his rightful place in history is secured.’ — Gordon Brown</li>

      <li>‘This captivating, ground-breaking book firmly re-establishes Lord Haldane in the national consciousness as a
        remarkable statesman of the early twentieth century. Many of his innovations are still flourishing today, and his
        thoughts on statecraft have much to teach our leaders.’ — Sir Anthony Seldon, British political biographer</li>

      <li>‘An outstanding biography that will have Haldane recognised, at long last, as one of our very greatest
        twentieth-century statesmen.’ — Sir Malcolm Rifkind, former Secretary of State for Defence and Foreign
        Secretary</li>

      <li>‘My Grandfather found Haldane to be unfailingly kind and in particular supported him in 1915 when Haldane lost
        Office. This book brings Haldane marvellously to life, centre stage on the then political map of Britain. It not
        only remarkably tells Haldane’s extraordinary and neglected story, but the exceptional images so cleverly
        illustrate his life and the turbulent times in which he lived. A must read.’ — The Rt Hon Sir Nicholas Soames</li>

      <li>‘Impressively well-researched, wonderfully written and so obviously relevant to the present day.’ — Brendan
        Simms, Professor in the History of International Relations, University of Cambridge, and author of Britain’s
        Europe: A Thousand Years of Conflict and Cooperation</li>

      <li>‘We should thank John Campbell and we should thank Haldane. Haldane saw what our country needed and he quietly
        and brilliantly introduced those changes and creations, many of which are still with us. We in intelligence, and
        many others, are much indebted to Haldane. Mr Campbell tells us why.’ — Sir Colin McColl KCMG, former chief of
        MI6</li>

      <li>‘Most politicians would view themselves as an outstanding success if only one of Haldane’s reforms were credited
        to them. He transformed the British Army, brought into existence many of the great civic universities, and even
        proposed a Supreme Court 100 years ahead of his time. John Campbell brings Haldane to the front of the political
        stage, where he belongs, and details well his supreme intellect and political method, which has so much to teach
        for today’s politics.’ — The Rt Hon Frank Field DL, former MP</li>

      <li>‘A welcome and enjoyable biography of a towering yet overlooked figure — Haldane was a transforming war minister,
        a visionary Lord Chancellor, a passionate supporter of education, and much more. Like the best biographies, this
        book casts revealing light on the times in which he lived.’ — The Rt Hon. The Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, former
        President of the UK Supreme Court</li>

      <li>‘Few if any of today’s public figures can stand comparison with Haldane, architect of so much of what we take for
        granted in our government and civic society. Campbell’s account summons back to life this giant of public
        administration.’ — Professor Sir David Omand GCB, former Director of GCHQ and Home Office Permanent Secretary</li>

      <li>‘An immensely readable, painstakingly researched biography of a little-known polymath statesman to whom Britain
        is more indebted than it knows. In this Who’s Who of early-twentieth-century politics, Campbell delves deep into
        Haldane’s complex and fascinating personality, in so many ways ahead of his time. He makes his hero our hero.’ —
        Sir Peter Westmacott GCMG LVO, former British Ambassador to Turkey, France and the United States</li>

      <li>‘A refreshing and compelling new biography of the leading philosopher-statesman of modern Britain. Haldane has
        had enormous influence, not least in re-organising the British Army to prevent a quick German victory in 1914, as
        well as in developing British education, the security services and the machinery of modern government.’ — Martin
        Pugh, former Professor of History, Newcastle University, and author of The Making of Modern British Politics</li>

      <li>‘I wish I could have read this as my guidebook before taking on my Prime Ministerial duties, back in 2009. Now I
        can only hope that current and future leaders will use their chance to do so.’ — Gordon Bajnai, former Prime
        Minister of Hungary</li>

      <li>‘A meticulously researched life of Haldane which rightly defines him as the ultimate polymath. Haldane’s multiple
        achievements are a lesson to today’s politicians: that so much more can be achieved by reaching across party lines
        when searching for benign change. We have all forgotten how much our military, intelligence services, universities
        and research communities continue to benefit from Haldane’s impact, a century later. This work sets the record
        straight.’ — Sir David Cooksey GBE, Chair of the Francis Crick Institute</li>

      <li>‘The debt the United Kingdom owes to Haldane is as great as to any other statesman of the first half of the
        twentieth century. John Campbell’s immensely readable study reminds us of the achievements of this extraordinary
        public servant. Haldane’s instinct to work constructively across the Party divide shows the importance of broad
        consensus in delivering lasting institutional reform. His search for long-term solutions to our country’s needs
        has never seemed more apposite.’ — Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury, former Leader of the House of
        Lords</li>

      <li>‘A remarkably intimate story of an exceptional man who created the British Army of 1914. These carefully
        considered reforms, resolutely fought for by Haldane in 1907, saved the nation from defeat.’ — Major-General Sir
        Evelyn Webb-Carter</li>

      <li>‘A truly superb book. Not only is it a remarkable biography of an extraordinary life, it also provides important
        insights into Haldane’s role in laying the foundations of the British university system. It traces how his
        education in Scotland and Germany moulded his beliefs about the purpose of life and the capacity of universities
        to inspire minds that contribute to the intellectual advancement and well-being of society. A profoundly humane
        account of one of Britain’s most enlightened and influential, yet insufficiently recognised, reformers of the
        twentieth century.’ — Colin Mayer CBE FBA, Peter Moores Professor of Management Studies, Said Business School,
        University of Oxford</li>

      <li>‘The great sadness is that Richard Haldane was Chancellor of St Andrews, Scotland’s first university, for only
        two months before he died in August 1928. In inviting him to fill this key governing role, St Andrews knew it was
        appointing one of “the most powerful, subtle and encyclopaedic intellects ever devoted to the public service of
        his country”. This great and long overdue book explains why St Andrews was so keen to make him one of its own.’ —
        Sir Ewan Brown CBE FRSE, former senior governor of the University of St Andrews</li>

      <li>‘Makes the case splendidly for Haldane’s achievements and his importance to this country … Anyone interested in
        British political history who is unacquainted with Haldane will find this
        book both illuminating and informative, a genuine revelation … Truly a lifetime’s dedicated work.’ — Intelligence
        and National Security</li>
